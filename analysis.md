## Introduction

### Classification Problem 1

The first classification problem is to predict whether an employee will stay in their new job for at least 6 months. I work for an HR Analytics company that builds pre-hire survey modules in an effort to help our clients hire better. Employee retention is very important to us and we're always looking for questions or sets of questions that give an indication as to whether a new hire will be engaged on the job. As well, clients are particularly interested in predicting whether a new hire will churn so they can engage in better workforce planning.

Specifically, these data come from a single client, anonymized to keep the orgzanization and the individual employees hidden. The data covers all employees hired between 2018-01-01 and 2022-03-01 so that a full 6 months of data will be available for each employee. (Including all hires up until today would be a censored data problem whereby some employees are still employed but have not yet worked 6 months, adding complexity beyond the scope of this assignment.)
